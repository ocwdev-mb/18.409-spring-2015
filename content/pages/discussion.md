Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
--------------------------------

Discussion: When does well-posedness lead to better algorithms?

Balcan, M., A. Blum, et al. ["Clustering under Approximation Stability." (PDF)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eninamf/papers/clustering-bbg-jacm.pdf) _Journal of the ACM_ (2013).

Tensor Decompositions
---------------------

Discussion: When do algorithms rely (too much) on a distributional model?

Feige, U., and J. Kilian. "[Heuristics for Semirandom Graph Problems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jcss.2001.1773)." _Journal of Computing and System Sciences_ 63, no. 4 (2001): 639–71.

Sparse Coding
-------------

Discussion: When does belief propagation (provably) work?

Geman, S., and D. Geman. "[Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4767596/)." _Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence_ (1984).

Learning Mixture Models
-----------------------

Discussion: Is nature an adversary? And if not, how can we model and exploit that?

Bhaskara, A., M. Charikar, et al. "[Smoothed Analysis of Tensor Decompositions](http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3651)." _Symposium on Theory of Computing_ (2014).

Linear Inverse Problems
-----------------------

Discussion: Do we have enough average-case assumptions?

Berthet, Q., and P. Rigollet. "[Computational Lower Bounds for Sparse PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0828)." _Conference on Learning Theory_ (2013).

Chandrasekaran, V., and M. Jordan. "[Computational and Statistical Tradeoffs via Convex Relaxation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1302293110)." _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America_ 110, no. 13 (2013): E1181–90.
